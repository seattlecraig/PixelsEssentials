HOME SYSTEM

Save locations and teleport back to them anytime.

Commands:
/home - List your homes
/home <n> - Teleport to home
/sethome - Set home named "home"
/sethome <n> - Set named home
/delhome <n> - Delete a home
/homeinfo <n> - View coordinates
=====================================
PAGE 3
=====================================
SETTING HOMES

Stand where you want your home, then type:

/sethome

This creates a home called "home".

For a custom name:
/sethome base
/sethome farm
/sethome mine

Names can use letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes (max 32 characters).
=====================================
PAGE 4
=====================================
UPDATING HOMES

To move an existing home to your current location, use the same name:

/sethome farm

If "farm" already exists, it updates to your new location.

This does NOT count against your home limit.
=====================================
PAGE 5
=====================================
TELEPORTING HOME

To go to a specific home:
/home farm

To see all your homes:
/home
or
/homes

This shows your homes and how many you have (like 3/5).
=====================================
PAGE 6
=====================================
HOME INFO

To see coordinates of a home:
/homeinfo farm

This shows the world name and X, Y, Z location.

To see your home count:
/homeinfo
=====================================
PAGE 7
=====================================
DELETING HOMES

To remove a saved home:

/delhome farm

The home is permanently deleted.

You can create a new one with the same name later.
=====================================
PAGE 8
=====================================
BACK COMMAND

Returns you to your previous location.

After teleporting somewhere:
/back

This takes you back to where you were standing before the teleport.
=====================================
PAGE 9
=====================================
BACK AFTER DEATH

If you die, /back can return you to your death spot:

/back

The plugin tracks teleport and death locations separately.

Returning to death locations requires permission.
=====================================
PAGE 10
=====================================
REPAIR COMMANDS

Fix your damaged items!

/repair hand
Repairs the item you're holding.

=====================================
REPAIR DETAILS

Only damageable items can be repaired:
- Tools
- Weapons  
- Armor

Items already at full durability will show a message.

You'll see a list of all items that were repaired.

=====================================
AUTOFEED

Automatically keeps you fed!

/autofeed on
Enable autofeed

/autofeed off

/autofeed

=====================================
PAGE 13
=====================================
HOW AUTOFEED WORKS

When enabled:
- Your hunger is monitored
- When it drops to 16 or below (lost 4+ points)
- Hunger restores to full (20)
- Saturation also restores to full

Your setting is saved between sessions.
=====================================
PAGE 14
=====================================
EXTENDED ENDER CHEST

If you have the permission, your ender chest is upgraded to 54 slots (double size)!

The first 27 slots work like normal. The extra 27 slots give you more storage.
=====================================
PAGE 15
=====================================
EXTENDED ENDER CHEST

Works when you:
- Right-click an ender chest
- Use /ec command

Your extra slots persist across deaths, just like normal ender chests.
=====================================

DEATH PROTECTIONS

You may have special protections when you die:

Keep Inventory
Your items stay with you.

Keep XP
Your experience is preserved.
